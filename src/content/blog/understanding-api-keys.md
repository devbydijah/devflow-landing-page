## The Importance of API Keys

API keys are unique identifiers used to authenticate requests associated with your project or application. They serve several crucial purposes:

- **Authentication:** Verifying the identity of the calling application.
- **Authorization:** Determining if the application has permission to access the requested resource.
- **Rate Limiting & Quotas:** Tracking usage to enforce limits and prevent abuse.

### Best Practices for API Key Security

1.  **Keep them Secret:** Treat API keys like passwords. Never embed them directly in client-side code or commit them to public repositories.
2.  **Use Environment Variables:** Store API keys in environment variables on your server.
3.  **Principle of Least Privilege:** Grant API keys only the permissions they absolutely need.
4.  **Rotate Keys Regularly:** Periodically regenerate your API keys to minimize the impact of a compromised key.
5.  **Monitor Usage:** Keep an eye on API key usage to detect any suspicious activity.
