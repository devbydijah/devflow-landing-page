# Copilot Custom Instructions: DevAPI Landing Page

## Project Overview

You are assisting with the development of the **DevAPI Landing Page**â€”a modern, developer-centric landing page for an API platform. The stack uses **Astro** (for page composition/routing), **React** (for interactive UI components, written in TypeScript), and **Tailwind CSS** (for all styling). Code must be clean, responsive, and aligned with best practices for developer experience and accessibility.

## Tech Stack

- **Astro (V5.x):** Page composition, routing  
- **React (TypeScript):** UI components  
- **Tailwind CSS (V4.x):** Utility-first styling  
- **Lucide React:** Icons  
- **Performance:** Optimized loading, smooth scroll, responsive

## Copilot Guidelines

- **Use Astro for page structure and routing; React (TSX) for UI components.**
- **All styling via Tailwind CSS.** Avoid inline/global styles unless necessary.
- **Ensure full mobile responsiveness and accessibility** (semantic HTML, aria tags as needed).
- **Use Lucide React for icons.**
- **Write clean, well-typed TypeScript.**
- **Prioritize developer-friendly language and copy.**
- **No authentication, playgrounds, testimonials, or community showcase yet** (these are for future phases).
- **Optimize for fast load and smooth navigation.**
- **Document components with clear props and comments.**
